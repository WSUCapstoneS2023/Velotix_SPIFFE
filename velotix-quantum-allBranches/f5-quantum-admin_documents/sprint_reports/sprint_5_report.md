Our sponsor requested that we use Discord last year, so we continued to use Discord this year. We will post transcripts of our Discord messages with our sponsor in MS Teams. We have separate messages between us team members as well that we can also show at your request if necessary.

#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Emma|I believe that I put in a lot of work this sprint in terms of time and effort and I definately exceeded past the 9 hours/points per week. My main focuses were benchmarking and the presentation. I did all the benchmarking for Envoy and added additional benchmarking for NGINX. In addition, I added more test scripts for the benchmarking and modified some of the previous test scripts. In terms of the presentation, I created slides for my portion of the presentation and attended meetings where I helped the group decide which other slides to include. I also spent numerous hours practicing my part of the presentation and sending my sponsor videos of my presentation so he could provide feedback and I could edit the presentation accordingly. |

### Retrospective
[Link to Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqzFH5EDT5E)

#### What went well
  - <i>We were able to come to compromises by listening to each other and being open to new ideas </i>
  - <i>Occassional offline reviews where we would send our sponsor videos of our part of the presentation</i>
  - <i>Meeting more than twice a week to practice presentation</i>
  - <i>Regular communications and updates over discord</i>
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - <i>Be better about getting started on tasks right after a meeting rather than starting them the night before the next meeting</i>
  - <i>Give more input during meetings even if the topic is not necesarily something you are working on  </i>
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - <i> Get started on more complex problems early so that we have time to reach out to others if necessary and work on other tasks while we are blocked  </i>
  - <i> Meet 4 to 5 times per week for 1hr+ to practice presentation</i>
