## Link to Online Communication Channel
Our sponsor requested that we use Discord last year, so we continued to use Discord this year. We will post transcripts of our Discord messages with our sponsor in MS Teams. Halfway through this sprint our sponsor requested that we switch to Whatsapp for communication so I have added some of those messages as well as emails as well. Please note that my phone got stolen so I lost most of the Whatsapp communication.

#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Emma|I put in a lot of work this sprint, especially considering we had the conference.  Prior to the conference, I met with our team almost everyday in the mornings to finish up the slides and practice our presentation. Aside from that, I was also practicing my portion of the presentation on my own. Then, I went to the conference in Detroit for three days where we spent the time leading up to our presentation practicing for a few hours each day in person. I also spent time there learning more about cloud native through listening to other talks and networked with people at other companies to tell them about our project. During this sprint I also did more benchmarking for testing of Envoy. After the conference, I met with my sponsor and started working on the next steps of the project which is to build a blueprint to help other companies in the cloud native landscape begin to begin incorporating post-quantum security measures.
