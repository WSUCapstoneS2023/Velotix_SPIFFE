#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Dan| My contribution to the team was an equitable portion, and mostly focused on the docker build portion of the sprint. I spent a fair bit of time developing and debugging. Most of the work prior was manually building environments from source, and working to set up each others so we could have a diverse set of testing environemnts. |
|Emma| I think that I contributed a fair share of work during this sprint. I definitely put in well over 9 hours each week. It took me a lot of work to build NGINX from source on my laptop with openssl manually. I also helped debug the Opensll-NGINX build Docker file. During the debug process, I ended up having to spend time re-setting up my working enviroment. Lastly, I worked on the sprint report. |
|Connor| During this sprint I spent more time on trying to manually build and install our required software than I hope to ever spend installing/configuring something ever again. I spent a lot of time with the team trying to troubleshoot this issue and figuring out what will work for all of us. Additionally I worked with Matt on formulating a way to consolidate or development environment, and worked with Emma on creating the sprint report. |
|Matt| This milestone, I figured out how to build NGINX from sources and install Open Quantum Safe's version of OpenSSL. I helped test Daniel's docker image he created by pulling his code and testing it on my laptop. I worked with Connor and looked into how we can consolidate our dev environment. I also made a diagram explaining how OQS's OpenSSL works with NGINX and I made a video for our sprint report. |

#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Communication Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Dan| Communication was a constant focus during this sprint, as we were often working individually, in pairs, and as a group. I felt like we coordinated fairly well throughout the development portion of the sprint; the frequency of our communications notably increased and directly contributed to this. |
|Emma| I think that my communication went well this sprint. I made sure to check our discord channel at least once daily and respond when necesary. In addition, I made sure that I gave lots of input during our zoom meetings. I was in contact with someone on our team almost daily about our project. One part of my communication that I want to improve next sprint is reaching out early when I am stuck.  |
|Connor| I felt like overall, the team and I did a good job of communicating this sprint. Personally, I checked discord and was available to my teammates (if needed) multiple times every day. Most days the entire team was active in communicating on discord and issues were expressed in a timely manner. Additionally, beyond our team discord I communicated frequently with all members of the team individually. |
|Matt| I think I did a decent job of communicating this sprint. I was active in our Discord and I attended all of our team meetings.|
### Retrospective

[Retrospective Meeting Recording](https://wsu.zoom.us/rec/share/NZC7A0Mwzzgi1SeuMogpkDKlOyHWl6YzyyJ2uHYZ3aQROsa7IJJNC66aqN6Lveaq.qT0ZOJf5CfPis7fE)


#### What went well
  - We had many productive meetings as a team where we would work together over zoom with two or more people.
  - Splitting up into groups of two to help eachother accomplish tasks. 
  - Frequent communication on discord and zoom.
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - Our communication with our sponsor. We'd like to reach out more frequently with our sponsor to clarify our tasks for the sprint. 
  - The time that we start working on each task. We'd like to start earlier on the week to recieve feedback earlier.
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - Meet on Thursday and Sunday mornings as a team in addition to our weekly Tuesday meetings to check in and have productive work time together.
  - Start tasks earlier in the week so that we have time to ask clarifying questions to our sponsor. 
  - Talk more about our personal schedules early on in the week so that we can plan accordingly.
