#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Dan| I feel very satisfied with my contribution to this sprint. I continued progress on the technical development I worked on over the summer, and am preparing for the coming presentation in October. I have become more proficient in software development wholistically with the technical challenges presented by the work so far. |
|Emma| I am satisfied with my work this sprint and feel like I have put in a substantial amount of work into the project. The first majority of the sprint I spent building the NGINX-OQS and Envoy-OQS forks on my new computer, so this took many hours. Building these forks allowed me to check how the instructions on our Github needed to be adjusted for running the builds on wsl, as the original instructions had not been tested on wsl. After that, I spent many hours doing benchmark testing on the and preparing a demo for these benchmarks to present at the conference that my team is attending. 

  
### Communication

### Retrospective
[Link to Recording](https://youtu.be/lUX1vMfCSaQ)

#### What went well
  - Item 1 <i>We trust each other and work well together. We know that if someone says that if a team member says they will have something done by the deadline that they will as neither member has even not completed something by a deadline (unless the circumstances have been talked through well beforehand). </i>
  - Item 2 <i>Our weekly Tuesday and Thursday meetings with our sponsor are productive. We get straight to the point and complete all of the tasks that we have planned for the meetings. These meetings are becoming increasingly helpful as we are now practicing demos in preparation for the conference.</i>
  - Item 3 <i>Consistent communication over discord to update each other on progress and ask questions.</i>
  - Item 4 <i>Fair division of labor. The work was split evenly in terms of effort and time spent on each task.</i>
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - Item 1 <i>More communication over the breaks between our Thursday and Tuesday meetings. Although we always end up getting our work done, it would be nice to know the progress of the other team members, before the weekend.</i>
  - Item 2 <i>Whenever we are blocked by a technical issue and have no other resources to help make forward progress, ask for help from the team rather than spend hours hopelessly trying to become unblocked. </i>
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - Item 1 <i> Send message to each other every Friday before midnight to recap our progress and mention any blockers. </i>
  - Item 2 <i> Whenever technical assistance is needed (blocked by a technical issue and have exhausted all other avenues such as Google searches), create an issue and message the discord or bring up in a meeting immediately. </i>
