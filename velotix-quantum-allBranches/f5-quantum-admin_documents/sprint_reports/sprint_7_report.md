## Link to Online Communication Channel
Starting this sprint, my communication with the sponsor has been completely over email and Whatsapp; previously our communication had been over Discord, but when my sponsor changed companies, we switched over to Whatsapp. I will post screenshots of our communication in Microsoft Teams. We had less communication this sprint as we did not have much code to talk about left, so we mostly caught up in our weekly meetings. There was not as much communication this sprint as we mostly communicated during our meetings which were already scheduled ahead of time last sprint; in addition, I did not have another team member to communicate with.

#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Emma|This sprint took a lot of effort filled hours for me. I was unable to accomplish as much as I wanted for the sponsor because I was spending at least 8 hours most weeks working on materials for this class (like the poster, presentation slides, final report, and sprint documents) all by myself. In addition, there are not as many deliverables for what I had done this sprint since my main task was to build a blueprint of the entire cloud native stack which took hours of research to do. This sprint, I worked on the Cloud Native Blueprint Document as well as creating issues for which parts of the Cloud Native Stack need to be upgraded to be quantum resistant. I also added in a demo video explaining the build code for quantum-resistant Envoy.

### Retrospective

#### What went well
  - <i>Look at other diagrams for design examples</i>
  - <i>Utilized different resources (videos, articles, ext.) and took notes to learn about interaction between parts of the cloud native stack</i>
  - <i>Formulated questions before meeting to ask sponsor</i>
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - <i>More communication with sponsor outside of meetings</i>
  - <i>Spend more time on tasks for sponsor rather than tasks for the class</i>
  - <i>Finish designs earlier to get feedback before meetings</i>
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - <i>Turn designs into sponsor early for feedback</i>
  - <i>Make prioritized list of tasks</i>
  - <i>Communicate with sponsor at least one time between meetings</i>
